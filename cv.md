##Small information about me:
I am a beginner in frontend development and my name is Denis. I started to get quite interested in computers and their device from the age of 6, then they gave me my first computer. From about the 5th grade, when computer science began, I began to get involved in programming and algorithmization, an extensive understanding of the device of the system I work with and the technical devices of the computer. In the 9th grade, where I am currently studying, I chose a direction for my future work: frontend. And now I continue to study and go to my goal.
##My skills:
1. Javascript (beginner).
2. HTML & CSS (advanced).
3. Python (beginner).
4. Pascal ABC and FreePascal (advanced).
5. Photoshop (advanced).
##Cod example:
```
program minSquareOfRectangle;
var a:array[1..10] of integer;
var b:array[1..5] of integer;
var i,c,min,g:integer;
begin

for i:= 1 to 10 do a[i]:= random(99) + 1;
writeln();

i:= 1; g:= 1;

while  i < 10 do
begin
i:= i+1; c:= a[i]; i:= i-1;

b[g]:= a[i] * c;
write(b[g], ' ');

i:= i+2; g:= g+1;
end;

min:= b[1];

for i:= 1 to 5 do
if min > b[i] then min:= b[i];
write(' Min:',min);

end.
// This code from a one-dimensional array with the length and width written sequentially returns the minimum area of the rectangle
